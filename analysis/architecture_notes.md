# FastMCP Architecture Analysis

## Core Design Principles

1. **Decorator-Based API**: Uses Python decorators (@mcp.tool, @mcp.resource, @mcp.prompt) for clean, intuitive registration
2. **Type-Driven**: Leverages Python type hints for automatic schema generation
3. **Context-Aware**: Provides rich context objects for advanced server capabilities
4. **Transport Agnostic**: Supports multiple transport protocols (STDIO, HTTP, SSE)

## Key Components

### 1. FastMCP Server Class
- Central orchestrator for all MCP functionality
- Manages tool, resource, and prompt registries
- Handles server lifecycle and transport management
- Supports middleware and authentication

### 2. Manager Classes
- **ToolManager**: Handles tool registration, validation, and execution
- **ResourceManager**: Manages static and dynamic resources
- **PromptManager**: Handles prompt templates and generation

### 3. Context System
- Provides tools/resources access to server capabilities
- Enables logging, LLM sampling, HTTP requests
- Supports progress reporting and resource access

### 4. Transport Layer
- **STDIO**: For command-line tools and local development
- **HTTP**: For web deployments with streamable responses
- **SSE**: For Server-Sent Events compatibility

## Design Patterns

### 1. Registry Pattern
Each manager (tools, resources, prompts) maintains a registry of registered items with duplicate handling strategies.

### 2. Context Injection
The Context object is automatically injected into functions that declare it as a parameter.

### 3. Middleware Chain
Request/response processing through configurable middleware stack.

### 4. Composition Pattern
Servers can be mounted or imported into other servers for modular architecture.

## Key Insights

1. **Minimal Boilerplate**: Most functionality requires just a decorator
2. **Production Ready**: Built-in auth, middleware, error handling
3. **Extensible**: Plugin architecture through middleware and composition
4. **Testing Friendly**: In-memory transport for efficient testing
5. **Type Safe**: Heavy use of type hints and Pydantic models

## Comparison to Raw MCP

FastMCP abstracts away:
- Protocol message handling
- Schema generation
- Server lifecycle management
- Transport implementation
- Error handling and validation

While providing:
- High-level Pythonic API
- Advanced features (auth, middleware, composition)
- Production deployment tools
- Comprehensive testing framework
